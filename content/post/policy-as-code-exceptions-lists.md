For those who donâ€™t know what conftest is, it is an open source utility that helps engineers write tests against structured configuration data. At the time of writing, conftest supports a number of formats such as YAML, JSON, Dockerfile, and HCL/HCL2 amongst others. This allows teams validate their configurations prior to making changes to live systems.

Conftest relies on the Rego language from Open Policy Agent for writing the assertions, which is a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and offload your policy decision-making from your software.

More, coming soon.
